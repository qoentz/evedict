predict_events: |
  Based on the following articles, predict two future events that are likely to take place. 
  Output the prediction as a JSON object with exactly two key-value pairs, each containing 
  a "title" and "content" field. Do not explain or reference the articles, just give the 
  predictions as structured JSON. Use the following format:

  {
    "predictions": [
      {
        "title": "Prediction Title 1",
        "content": "Details of the first predicted event."
      },
      {
        "title": "Prediction Title 2",
        "content": "Details of the second predicted event."
      }
    ]
  }

  Here are the articles:
  {{range .Articles}}
  - Title: {{.Title}}
    Content: {{.Content}}
  {{end}}
